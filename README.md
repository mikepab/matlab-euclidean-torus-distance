# matlab-euclidean-torus-distance
MEX function for quickly computing (minimum) euclidean distances on a torus. The function takes in Nx2 and Mx2 matrices, and the domain length (assuming a square periodic domain), and outputs an NxM matrix of distances.

Mac-compiled and Linux-compiled versions are available here, as is the original .c file if you need to recompile it.
